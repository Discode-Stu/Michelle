# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

As I stop, and take the time
To inventory, the inside of my mind
I realize, it’s not as full as it used to be.
With images of justice, or desires of liberty
The world has changed, or is it me that’s new?
A different set of morale’s from a different set of clues
So still I wonder, is this all there is to life?
The ever changing cycles, in a world that’s damp and rife
There must more, yah my heart I hold to this
I’ve enjoyed love and I’ve seen the peace and bliss
But as you know, all things must end, except the need for faith
And the spirit that’s within to keep you strong

Move forward with power, program yourself to feel
With depth enough to know what’s up and heart to sense the real

Where you at?

As I stop, for the frame we set aside
Below the baseline a secret place awaits for us to hide.
To pass the time as the war goes on-and-on.
A post-apocalyptic sunset, a post-apocalyptic dawn
Of just a though of the world we want possessed
A place that wasn’t honest was just a house with an address.
Of existence, wrought with fear and mistrust, a life inside a box
No life inside of us.
Find you soul, use your inner voice,
The road less traveled, is now the path of choice.
Realize, with time comes change
New attitudes, new values, priorities rearranged.

Move forward with power, program yourself to feel
With depth enough to know what’s up and heart to sense the real

Where you at?
